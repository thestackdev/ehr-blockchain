<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This Project is based on blockchain where we can store the electronic health records.We apply Ethereum blockchain to compose a smart contract which holds the public key of
the record stored in the decentralised Inter Planetary File System (IPFS). To protect a patientâ€™s
privacy, we have a tendency to use a proxy re-encryption theme once the info square measure
transferred. we have a tendency to designed and implemented numerous smart contracts to handle
business logic in agreement by member organizations of the network.
This is how we do it:
* We create a contract for every patient
* Whatever documents the patient adds we add it in IPFS.
* we retrieve the hash and store it in blockchain.
* For a particular record access is given only to the doctor and patient.
